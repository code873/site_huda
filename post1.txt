Halo guys, i'm <h4 align="center"><u>MUHAMMAD</u> <u>NURUL</u> <u>HUDA</u></h4>Welcome to my original site. This site would be a nice place for me to speak indirectly about my random mind and some issues. As an introduction::<br>
I'm an amateur programmer from Indonesia having skill on some languages including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> for front-end web development and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> for software and network development stuff. I also work in another different area specifically teaching mathematics for high school students. As an amateur, i amn't quite ready to plunge take a programming job. I need more studying. Fun fact! i'm a Mathematician :) specifically focused on discrete mathematics. This field has a strong relation to computer science rather than other mathematical fields. Algorithm concepts exist there, so it's fine for me to run both items. I have an attracted story::<br>
When i was 16, i really love computer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> as i can remember (those are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">debian</a>, etc). I was learned programming at that time, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and Python. I was fascinating at exploring new knowledge, broad base on that stuff, even hacking activity. But, AI wasn't show up yet so that i just having it for fun (almost never success of doing that). The greed for curiosity made me lost my laptop (ASUS). The keyboard and the motherboard were crashed since i did typing and changing OS quite frequently. This is a bad habit and i dont want to do that anymore. The saddness was one of the reason of why i chose mathematics (not informatics or computer science) as a good thing to put my carrier. I believe in math, i have a good rate on average along my university journeys. Long story short, after 6 years spending times in mathematical world, routing problem-solving everyday everytime on my desk. The result was unexpectedfull, i completed around 10 papers where around 70% published in <a href="www.scopus.com">Scopus</a> (check on Links: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DrUbbLQAAAAJ&hl=en">Maths Repo</a>). But, i've just realized that mathematician easily get difficult to have their place in Indonesia, instead of programmer. Recently, i touch math when i'm teaching it to students or preparing class material. The maneuver is really challenging but rather painful because i've lost mathematical theory that i've loved along 6 years, that i've spent ten of millions of rupiah to get a BSc and a MSc titles, etc, and all of those are changed in only one week of decision. I bravely take this way because this is not something new for me, i was diving to this, and the carrier possibly guarranted as i see my brother. He was a great programmer (see <a href="http://http://war49.a0001.net/">his site</a>). He is the man who introduce me how lovely computer, linux, and programming are. I dont know without him (in the past), maybe i do not typing this HTML scripts tonight. He is a great influencer man in my life and i'm very lucky to have him as my big brother. Currently, he is an enterprise architect enginer of a great company in Jakarta. Therefore, i decided to get back to programming. For the first step, i'm focusing on web development (mastering HTML, CSS, JS, and their frameworks) to get a temporary job in a good salary and Python are the next target. I hope this is the right choice to have a bright life in the future.<br>
Thank you for reading !
